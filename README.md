This is a repository including source codes related to basic Kotlin concepts

## Concepts
* Variables
* Strings

### Variables
There are two type of variables - mutable (values can be changed) and immutable (values cannot be changed)
*"var"* keyword is used to declare mutable variables ands *"val"* keyword is used to declare immutable variables.

Kotlin has type inference that means we don't have to declare type of a variable. However, if required we can explicitly set the type of variable.

Variables can be converted to different types using toSting(), toDouble(), etc.

### Strings
